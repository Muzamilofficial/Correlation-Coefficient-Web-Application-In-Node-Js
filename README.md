# 📊 Correlation and Regression Calculator
This is a web-based application that calculates the correlation coefficient and performs linear regression analysis. The app also predicts `y` for a given `x` based on the regression equation.

## 🧑‍💻 Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js
- **Chart.js**: For graph rendering
- **Math.js**: To perform mathematical operations like sum and square
- **Particles.js**: For creating a dynamic background

## ⚙️ Features
- Calculate **correlation coefficient** between two sets of data
- Generate a **regression line** based on the input values
- **Predict y** for a specific x using the regression equation
- Dynamic **graph rendering** using **Chart.js**
- Cool **background animation** with **Particles.js**
